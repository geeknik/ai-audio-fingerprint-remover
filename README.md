## Overview

AI Audio Fingerprint Remover is a powerful tool designed to address privacy concerns by removing all identifiable AI-generated traces from audio files. Modern AI systems like Suno, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and others often embed various types of fingerprints in their generated audioâ€”both visible metadata and hidden statistical patterns.

This tool implements multiple layers of protection to counter all known and theoretical fingerprinting techniques, ensuring your audio files maintain privacy while preserving quality.

## Features

### Complete Metadata Removal
- Strips all standard metadata (ID3, RIFF INFO, FLAC tags)
- Removes AI-specific tags and custom chunks
- Eliminates hidden identifiers in binary data
- Supports multiple formats: MP3, WAV, FLAC, AIFF

### Spectral Watermark Detection & Elimination
- Identifies and removes high-frequency watermarks
- Detects periodic patterns in specific frequency bands
- Applies targeted filters to neutralize watermarks
- Adds naturalistic noise to defeat absence-based fingerprinting

### Statistical Pattern Normalization
- Detects and corrects machine-like timing patterns
- Identifies unnatural amplitude distributions
- Normalizes frequency distributions
- Adds realistic micro-variations in timing

### Human-Like Imperfections
- Introduces subtle non-linearities in harmonics
- Adds realistic micro-dynamics
- Creates natural stereo imaging variations
- Applies minor phase adjustments

### Robust Verification
- Provides detailed reports of modifications
- Offers before/after metadata comparison
- Verifies effectiveness through hash comparison
- Handles batch processing for multiple files

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries: numpy, scipy, librosa, soundfile, mutagen

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/geeknik/ai-audio-fingerprint-remover.git
cd ai-audio-fingerprint-remover
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install numpy scipy librosa soundfile mutagen
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

**Process a single file:**
```
python ai_audio_fingerprint_remover.py input.mp3 output.mp3
```

**Process a file in-place:**
```
python ai_audio_fingerprint_remover.py input.wav
```

**Process all audio files in a directory:**
```
python ai_audio_fingerprint_remover.py --directory input_folder output_folder
```

### Advanced Options

**Aggressive Mode** (more thorough but may slightly affect quality):
```
python ai_audio_fingerprint_remover.py input.mp3 output.mp3 --aggressive
```

**View Metadata Before Removal:**
```
python ai_audio_fingerprint_remover.py --show input.wav output.wav
```

**Generate Detailed Report:**
```
python ai_audio_fingerprint_remover.py input.mp3 output.mp3 --report
```

**Verify Results:**
```
python ai_audio_fingerprint_remover.py input.mp3 output.mp3 --verify
```

## Example Output

## Under the Hood

The tool implements a multi-layered approach to address all known and theoretical AI fingerprinting techniques:

1. **First Pass**: Complete metadata stripping, removing all standard and custom tags.
2. **Second Pass**: Spectral analysis to detect watermarks, applying targeted band-reject filters.
3. **Third Pass**: Statistical pattern analysis to detect machine-like distributions, normalizing them to human-like patterns.
4. **Final Pass**: Addition of subtle human-like imperfections to counter AI detection models that look for "too perfect" audio.

## Privacy and Security

- Processing is done entirely on your local machine - no data is sent to external servers
- No logs or processed audio data are stored unless you explicitly save them
- The tool is designed for legitimate privacy protection, not for removing copyright protections

## Limitations

- Extremely aggressive watermarks might require quality trade-offs to fully remove
- Some countermeasures may minimally impact audio quality (typically inaudible)
- Cannot remove content-based fingerprinting (where the actual content itself is the fingerprint)
